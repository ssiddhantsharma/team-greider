> This is the main repository for the Stage_0 task for the HackBio'2021 Virtual Internship Experience for #Team-Greider. <br>
The Main goal of the project is write small scripts in different languages with the output: `name, e-mail, slack_username, biostack, `. Next step is to make csv file with rows corresponding to the person and columns to the values (as name, e-mail, etc) ysing different scripts. All members of the team will fork the Github Repository and make the neccesary commits for task for Stage_0. This README.md contains all the necessary information to replicate the workflows for this task. <br>

# üß¨ Getting Started

# üîß Usage 
The main goal of the project is to create a bash script that will clone the repo and produce a csv file with the participants' personal information. For this goal no installation is required, however check if all dependencies are satisfied. Please download the following script `csv-populator.sh`. Downloading and running the script can be done from a terminal with the following command:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssiddhantsharma/team-greider/master/csv-populator.sh && sh csv-populator.sh
```

## I am a newbie...
Everyone began from something (: Actually the language in this task doesn't matter, as the script is very simple.
You can search smth similar to "write hello world script in *language_of_interest* ".

A good start is to become more familiar with R or Python. Both of these languages are extremely popular within the bioinformatics community. See templates for "Hello world script" for [R](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hello-world-in-r-programming/) and [Python](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello,_World!).

## Unified template for output for #Team-Greider
Desired fields (for this task) can be printed out in many different ways. Therefore I propose a unified template for your script output:

```bash
NAME: *Your full name*
E-MAIL: *Your e-mail* 
SLACK USERNAME: @+*username*
BIOSTACK: *Name of biostack you chose*
TWITTER: @+*username*
HAMMING DISTANCE: *distance*
```
An example:
```bash
NAME: Siddhant Sharma
E-MAIL: siddhaantsharma.ss@gmail.com
SLACK USERNAME: @siddhant
BIOSTACK: Medicinal Chemistry and Cheminformatics
TWITTER: @sidd2508
HAMMING DISTANCE: 4
```
**After you get the desired output, please name your file _stage_0_slack-username_ <br> An example:** 
`stage_0_Siddhant.R`
